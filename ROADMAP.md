- [x] Create architecture: functional core imperative shell
- [x] Add ability to list all files
- [x] Add ability to construct commands for files
- [x] Wire up to shell
- [x] Redo code structure + add tests
- [x] Redo parsing to allow run modes and follow examples
- [x] Add ability to do multiple commands, e.g. split by a ';;'
- [ ] Add in where clauses to whitelist certain things, file types, etc. Example would be `where [EXT in [obj, gltf, png] DIR in [test/test/test]]`. Not sure what it will look like, maybe don't add in logicals (and, or) due to complexity right now.
- [ ] Add validation for interpolated vars depending on run mode.
- [ ] Add help option
- [ ] Fill out readme
- [ ] Do a deep dive on the blog
